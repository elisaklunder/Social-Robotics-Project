# Social-Robotics-Project
This repository contains the code developed during the Social Robotics Practical course at the University of Groningen, year 2024-25. \
The code is meant to be run on an Alphamini robot connected to the same network that the machine running the code is connected to.

### Organization of the repository.
The repository is organized in folders corresponding to the different assignments, plus some extra folders as follows:

```
Social-Robotics-Project/
│── assignment_1/           # Assignment 1 code 
│ │── gemini.py             # Interface with Gemini AI model 
│ │── main.py               # Main script for execution of assignment 1
│ └── prompt.txt            # Input prompt file 
│
│── assignment_2/           # Assingment 2 code
│ │── gemini.py             # Interface with Gemini AI model, same as assignment_1
│ │── gestures.             # Creates gestures for the robot to perform
│ │── main.py               # Main script for execution of assignment 2

```

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/elisaklunder/Social-Robotics-Project.git
   cd Social-Robotics-Project
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
    .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Rename example.env to .env:
    ```
    mv example.env .env
    ```

5. Open .env and add your Google Gemini API key (can be obtained for free at [this link](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)) and the realm of the robot (can be found when clicking on hamburger menu -> green "<>-icon" in the [robots in the class portal](https://portal.robotsindeklas.nl)):
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    REALM="your-alphamini-robot-realm"
    ```


## Assignment 1
The first assignment of the course required us to implement a social robot playing the With Other Words game. The game can be played by running the ```main.py``` script in the ```assignment_1``` folder.

## Assignment 2
The second assignment of the course required us expand on Assignment 1 and implement naturally-looking gestures for the social robot. The game with gestures can be played by running the ```main.py``` script in the ```assignment_2``` folder.
